**Example Response:**
```json
{
"1. The function `add` is simple and works as intended. However, consider adding type hints for better readability and error checking:\n\n```python\ndef add(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    return a + b\n```\n\n2. Add a docstring to explain what the function does:\n\n```python\ndef add(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Returns the sum of a and b.\"\"\"\n    return a + b\n```"
}
```
